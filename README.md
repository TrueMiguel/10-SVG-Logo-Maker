## Testing <a id="testing"></a>
The test is ran by creating a new instance of the 'shape.js' program. It then uses pre-made const to populate the information in the literal text. Next the 'shape.js' program is initiated with the pre-made const inserted into the fields. Finally using the .toContain to check if the correct information got inserted into the literal text and that everything matches.
